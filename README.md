# A cool way to use your own hands to 3D Model 

## Sumary

It uses **mediapipe** to process de data form the webcam into hand landmarks that are used to controll the mouse with your hands.
The code has a mode system based on the left hand gesture and moves the mouse acordingly to the mode's use. 
Made for 3DModeling with **FreeCAD**





## Why?

Because I was bored and wanted to 3d model like Tony Stark

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/HandControl.git
cd HandControl
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
